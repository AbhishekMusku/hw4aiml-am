# GPU Acceleration Project

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of Challenge #11 from the hw4aiml-am course, which focuses on GPU acceleration of machine learning code. The project optimizes the FrozenLake code from the Q-Learning Algorithm repository for GPU execution and compares performance between CPU and GPU implementations.

## Project Structure
- `challenge11.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, optimization, benchmarking, and **complete documentation**
- `frozen_lake8x8.png`: Visual representation of the FrozenLake environment
- `frozen_lake_q.py`: Python script with the Q-learning implementation

## Documentation
All documentation, including implementation details, performance results, key learnings, and analysis, is contained within the Jupyter notebook (`challenge11.ipynb`). The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of:
- The optimization approach
- GPU implementation techniques
- Benchmarking methodology
- Performance comparisons
- Analysis and insights

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook with the implementation and documentation:

```bash
jupyter notebook challenge11.ipynb
```
