# NN Performance: PyTorch vs. CUDA (Challenge #16)

## Overview
Implementation for Challenge #16 (ECE 410/510, Week 5), comparing PyTorch vs. direct CUDA performance for neural network (256x512x1) inference. Benchmarks GPU inference time against batch size 2^0 to 2^12 to analyze speed and scalability.
